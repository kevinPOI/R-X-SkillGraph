# VLM-Video-Action-Localization
This folder provides a sample code of a paper, [Open-vocabulary Temporal Action Localization using VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17422). This paper was authored by the [Applied Robotics Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/applied-robotics-research/) team.

### Overview of the pipeline:
![Temporal PIVOT pipeline](./src/pipeline.jpg)

## How to use
We have confirmed that the sample codes work with python 3.12.1

Modify the [auth.env](./auth.env)

### If you use Azure OpenAI
- AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
- AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT
- AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
### If you use OpenAI
- OPENAI_API_KEY

### Install dependencies
```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the sample code
```bash
python example.py --credentials auth.env --video sample_video/sample.mp4 --grid 3 --action "Grasping the can"
```
The `--grid N` option specifies the number of frames to extract, creating an image with an NxN grid tiling.
